Throughout my life, my fitness has not been very good. I've hated exercise for as long as I can remember. However, staying healthy requires exercise. I recently settled on cycling as a suitable form of exercise. I've tried to turn it into a game for myself to play instead of a chore to trudge through.

The idea is to ride on every road and path in Calgary and the surrounding region. This is a bigger job than you might expect as there is far asphalt out there than we realize. In order to track my progress, I have hooked up my Strava account to a service called <a href="https://wandrer.earth/">Wandrer</a>.
