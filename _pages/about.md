Hi! My name is Nolan McMahon. I'm the Machine Learning Specialist at a marketing and technology company called [LoKnow](https://loknow.com/). Currently I'm working on a product called [Rover](https://loknow.com/platforms/rover/) which uses machine learning to devise relevant search phrases for our client's websites.

Since I was a young boy, I've always had a keen interest in mathematics and the way that the world works. As a six year old, one of my favourite activities was to complete an endless book of sums. At age nine, I would compute enormous quotients. By the time I was thirteen, I was exasperated by endlessly tedious and slow-moving math classes in grade school, so I picked up nineth grade math and taught it to myself out of a textbook in three months.

From that point forward, I was hooked on self-directed learning. I didn't hop back into a math class with my peers until introductory calculus. I consistently scored the highest among my elder peers and would compete in extraciricular contests like the University of Waterloo's Fermat math contest, during which I scored the highest in my school.

My educational background is in physics. I graduated with an honours degree from the University of Calgary. While I was there, I fed my passion for self-directed learning by taking on many advanced topics which were beyond the scope of my degree. Throughout my degree, I took physics classes in:

- Classical Mechanics
- Electrodynmaics
- Themodynamics
- Electronics
- Applied Physics
- Modern Physics
- Optics
- Mathematical Physics
- Special and General Relativity
- Quantum Mechanics
- Computational Physics
- Quantum Statistical Physics

In my final year of formal studies, I wrote a thesis in contribution to the greater aim of verifying the efficacy of quantum computers in the context of np-complete problems. In so doing, I had the privilege of studying under the director of the Institute for Quantum Science and Technology, Distinguished Chair Professor at the University of Science and Technology of China, and member of the Royal Society of Canada, Dr. Barry Sanders. That research is still ongoing.

Post-graduation, I have continued to pursue my three main acedemic passions: physics, computer science, and mathematics. As such, machine learning specialist has been a perfect role for me to take on.
