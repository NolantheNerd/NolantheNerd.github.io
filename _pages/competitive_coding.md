# What is Competitive Coding?

Writing computer code is an art form, and as with more "traditional" forms of art, there are are a number of different ways to express yourself. Each technique is an infinite well of potential and learning opportunity. Some of the most popular competitive coding forms include:

## Minimizing Code Length

This is known as code golfing. The idea is to solve a computational problem with as few characters of code as possible. In an effort to optimize minimization, there are many languages written explicitly for code golf. [Pyth](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Pyth), for example, is a Python based language used for code golf. One great place to dip your toes into code golf is the [Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/). Here you can see new code golf problems, and other people's solutions in a number of different languages. Code golfing has never really turned my crank, but it certainly has garnered a passionate community.
