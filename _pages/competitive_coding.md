> Writing computer code is an art form, and as with more "traditional" forms of art, there are a number of different _objectively_ beautiful ways to express yourself. 

Competitive programming an activity which encourages the efficient and timely implementation of computer science/mathematical algorithms to solve contrieved problems. These problems come in any number of different flavours, varieties, and difficulties in an effort to appeal to a wide array of potential coding competitors. Participation in competitions and access to problems takes place through a number of different online resources like:

# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

My personal favourite portal to competitive coding, [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) contains problems which are an amalgamation of mathematics and computer science. There are more than 750 such problems, each ranked by difficulty, number of correct answer submissions, and chronological release date with more being released all the time on a regular schedule.

Project Euler keeps track of a number of different statistics so that you can compare your performace to others. Here is my profile badge:

I've included all the problems that I've solved, and my solutions [here]()!
